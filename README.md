# Game Structure
* The game begin by asking the name of the user their name to invite them in on a personal level
* For the game I created a game where the player has 8 lives to guess a word thorught the process of elimination
* If the user gets a incorrect letter, then a piece of the hangman image will appear
* Every letter tha is guessed will appear as to avoid repitition in the guesses
* If all guesses are made a message will appear to say the user is free to go, or needs to be taken to the undertaker, depending on the outcome

 # Future Features

 - In the future I would like to create a game where the numbers were pre selected using a specific algorithm, At the moment the game only has 3 boards with content, But it has 3 time levels which may add to the challenge
